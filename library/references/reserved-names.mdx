title: Reserved Names
description: List of reserved names and keywords that cannot be used for variables or functions in Eon.
---

---

Certain names are **reserved** in Eon and cannot be used for your own variables or functions. This prevents conflicts with the core language features, standard library, and built-in functions.

---

## Why are names reserved?

- To avoid accidental overwriting of important features or standard library functions.
- To ensure your code is compatible with current and future versions of Eon.

---

## List of Reserved Names

Below are names that **cannot** be used for variables or function names in your Eon code.

### Language Keywords
- f ([functions](/library/references/functions))
- v ([variables](/library/references/variables))
- return ([return values](/library/references/functions#return-values))
- if ([conditionals](/library/references/loops#if-statements))
- else ([conditionals](/library/references/loops#else-and-else-if))
- for ([loops](/library/references/loops#for-loops))
- while ([loops](/library/references/loops#while-loops))
- break ([loops](/library/references/loops#break-and-continue))
- continue ([loops](/library/references/loops#break-and-continue))
- true ([booleans](/library/references/variables#booleans))
- false ([booleans](/library/references/variables#booleans))
- null ([null values](/library/references/variables#null))
- main ([entry point](/library/references/functions#the-main-function))

<Note>
  The main function is the [entry point](/library/references/functions#the-main-function) of your Eon program. You must define a function named `main` to run your code.
  Because of this there is an exception to the rule: you **have** to use `main` as a **function** name **but cannot** use it as a variable name.
  Using `main` as a variable name will result in a compiler and transpiler **error**. You can also not use the name `main` **twice** in **functions** as that will cause an **error**.
</Note>

### Built-in Functions and Types

```text
print
input
len
typeof
range
int
float
str
bool
list
array
map
dict
set
exit
Error
```

### Standard Library & Internal

```text
libEon
std
os
sys
math
time
fs
args
env
log
```

## Notes

- Names are **case-insensitive** in Eon. For example, `Main`, `main`, and `MAIN` are all considered the same and are reserved.
- Using a reserved name for your own function or variable will result in a compiler or transpiler error.
- This list may expand as Eon grows and adds more built-in features.
