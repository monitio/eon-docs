---

Eon provides simple and effective ways to document your code using comments and **comment-functions** (Eon's version of docstrings). Proper documentation helps make your code more readable and maintainable.

## Single-Line Comments

You can use either `#` or `//` to write single-line comments in Eon. Both styles are supported, and everything after the comment marker on the same line is ignored by the compiler.

```eon
# This is a single-line comment
// This is also a single-line comment

v x = 10; // You can also place comments after code
v y = 10; # with both styles.
```

---

## Multi-Line Comments

Eon does **not** have a dedicated multi-line comment syntax, like `/* ... */`.
If you want to comment out multiple lines, add a `#` or `//` at the beginning of each line:

```eon
# This is a multi-line
# comment in Eon.
# Each line starts with a comment marker.

// This style works too
// for multiline comments.
```

## Comment-Functions (Docstrings)

Eon supports **comment-functions**, which are similar to docstrings in other languages.
A comment-function starts with a `~` symbol and can attach markdown or HTML documentation to functions, variables, or other code elements.

You can write a single-line comment-function:

```eon
~This function prints a greeting.
f greet() {
  print("Hello!");
}
```

Or use curly braces `{}` for multi-line documentation, including markdown:

```eon
~ {
Prints "Hello, world!"

- This function prints a greeting to the console.
- You can use markdown **formatting** here.

And you can use HTML as well if you want.
}
f hw() {
  print("Hello, world!");
}
```

- Comment-functions can be placed immediately before the function, variable, or type you want to document.
- Multi-line comment-functions can include markdown or HTML for rich documentation.
- These are used by code editors and tooling to provide inline docs, similar to Python docstrings or JSDoc.
