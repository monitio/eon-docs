---

Variables in Eon are used to store and manipulate data throughout your programs. This page provides an overview of variable declaration, types (including booleans and null), and usage patterns.

---

## Declaring Variables

To declare a variable in Eon, use the `v` keyword:

```eon
v myVar = "Hello, Eon!";
v number = 42;
```

- The `v` keyword is always required for variable declarations.
- Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and **underscores**, and are **case-insensitive**.
- You do **not** need to specify a type; Eon will automatically infer the type based on the assigned value.

---

## Assigning and Updating Variables

You can update the value of a variable by simply assigning a new value to it:

```eon
v greeting = "Hello";
greeting = "Hi there!";
```

---

## Variable Types

Eon supports the following basic types (type inference is automatic):

- **String**: `"text"`
- **Number**: `123`, `3.14`
- **Boolean**: `true`, `false`
- **Null**: `null` (represents the absence of a value)
- **List/Array**: `[1, 2, 3]`
- **Other types** may be supported in the future or via libraries.

### Booleans

Booleans represent truth values and are written as `true` or `false`:

```eon
v isActive = true;
v isEmpty = false;
```

You can use boolean variables in conditionals:

```eon
if isActive {
  print("The value is active!");
}
```

### Null

The `null` value represents the absence of a value or "nothing":

```eon
v data = null;
```

You can check for `null` in your code:

```eon
if data == null {
  print("No data available.");
}
```

---

## Scope

Variables are scoped to the function or block in which they are defined:

```eon
f example() {
  v x = 10;
  // x is accessible here
}
// x is not accessible here
```

---

## Examples

```eon
v count = 1;
v name = "Eon";
v isReady = true;
v wasFound = false;
v result = null;

count = count + 1;
name = "NewName";
isReady = false;
result = 100;
```

---

## Naming Rules

- Variable names cannot be the same as function names in the same scope.
- Certain names are **reserved** and cannot be used for variables (see [Reserved Names](/library/references/reserved-names)).
- Names are case-insensitive: `foo`, `FOO`, and `Foo` refer to the same variable.
