title: Loops & Conditionals
description: Reference for loops and conditional statements in Eon, including if, else, for, and while.
---

---

Control flow statements like loops and conditionals are essential for making decisions and repeating actions in your Eon programs. This page covers the main constructs: `if`, `else`, `while`, `for`, and related features.

---

## `if` Statements

Use `if` to execute code when a condition is true.

```eon
v x = 10;
if x > 5 {
  print("x is greater than 5");
}
```

- The condition goes immediately after `if` and before the `{}` block.
- No parentheses are required around the condition.

---

## `else` and `else if`

Use `else` to provide alternative code when the `if` condition is false.
You can chain multiple conditions with `else if`:

```eon
v x = 3;
if x > 5 {
  print("x is greater than 5");
} else if x == 5 {
  print("x is exactly 5");
} else {
  print("x is less than 5");
}
```

- `else` and `else if` must follow an `if` block.
- Only one `else` block is allowed, but multiple `else if` blocks can be chained.

---

## `while` Loops

Use `while` to repeat a block of code as long as a condition is true.

```eon
v count = 0;
while count < 3 {
  print("Count is", count);
  count = count + 1;
}
```

- The loop continues until the condition becomes false.
- Use `break` to exit the loop early, and `continue` to skip the rest of the current iteration.

---

## `for` Loops

Use `for` to iterate over elements in a list or range.

```eon
v items = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
for item in items {
  print("Fruit:", item);
}
```

Or, with a range:

```eon
for i in range(3) {
  print("Index:", i);
}
```

- The variable before `in` receives each element or index.
- Works with lists, strings, or any iterable.

---

## `break` and `continue`

- `break` exits the nearest enclosing loop.
- `continue` skips to the next iteration of the nearest enclosing loop.

```eon
v i = 0;
while i < 5 {
  i = i + 1;
  if i == 2 {
    continue; // Skip when i is 2
  }
  if i == 4 {
    break;    // Stop loop when i is 4
  }
  print(i);
}
// Output: 1, 3
```

---

## Nesting and Combining

You can nest and combine conditionals and loops for more complex control flow:

```eon
v items = [1, 2, 3];
for n in items {
  if n % 2 == 0 {
    print(n, "is even");
  } else {
    print(n, "is odd");
  }
}
```

---

## Summary

- Use `if`, `else if`, and `else` for conditional logic.
- Use `while` and `for` for loops.
- Use `break` and `continue` to control loop execution.
- No parentheses are required around conditions, but curly braces `{}` are always required for blocks.
