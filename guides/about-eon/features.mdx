Eon is designed to be a modern, flexible language that gets inspiration from Python, JavaScript, C, and other popular languages like Rust. Below is a list of Eon's unique features and how it stands out compared to other programming languages.

---

## Why pick Eon?

- **Use the same codebase for multiple targets**
- **Readable and maintainable syntax**
- **Automatic type inference**
- **First-class documentation support**
- **Cross-platform native binaries and scripting**

## Differences

Here's how Eon stands out compared to other languages:

| Feature                | **Eon**      | Python      | JavaScript   | C            |
|------------------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Transpiles to...**   | C, Python, JS| N/A         | N/A          | N/A          |
| **Native Binaries**    | Yes (via C)  | Via Cython  | Not without runtime | Yes   |
| **Type System**        | Inferred     | Dynamic     | Dynamic      | Static       |
| **Function Keyword**   | `f`          | `def`       | `function`/`=>` | Return type |
| **Variable Keyword**   | `v`          | None        | `let`/`var`/`const` | Type name |
| **Comment Styles**     | `//` or `#`  | `#`         | `//`/`/* */` | `//`/`/* */` |
| **Doc-Comments**       | `~` (markdown/HTML) | Docstring | JSDoc       | Doxygen     |
| **Case Sensitivity**   | Insensitive  | Sensitive   | Sensitive    | Sensitive    |
| **Standard Library**   | Yes ([libEon](/library))       | Yes         | Yes          | Yes          |

## Key Features

### 1. **Multi-Target Transpilation**
- **Transpile to C, Python, and JavaScript**
  Write code once in Eon and output to multiple target languages.
- **Native Binaries via C**
  Compile to C and then to native executables on any platform.
- **Scripting Outputs**
  Generate `.py` or `.js` files for scripting environments.

### 2. **Simple, Readable Syntax**
- **Minimalistic, Friendly Syntax**
  Easy to read and write, inspired by Python, JavaScript, C and Rust.
- **Flexible Comments**
  Use `#` or `//` interchangeably for line comments.
- **Doc-Comments ("Comment-Functions")**
  Use `~` for markdown/HTML documentation attached to code blocks.

### 3. **Functions & Variables**
- **Function Declarations with `f`**
  Define with `f name() { ... }`, call with or without brackets if no arguments.
- **Variable Declaration with `v`**
  No need for explicit types of variables; Eon picks the type of your variable automatically.

### 4. **Cross-Platform**
- **True "Write Once, Run Anywhere"**
  Compile your code for Windows, Linux, or macOS from the same Eon source.
- **No Runtime Lock-in**
  Choose between scripting and native binaries.

### 5. **Consistent Naming & Rules**
- **Case Insensitive**
  Variable and function names are case-insensitive, but cannot collide.
- **Reserved Words Protection**
  Safeguards against using reserved or built-in names.

### 6. **First-Class Documentation**
- **Comment-Functions for Docs**
  Use markdown and HTML in doc comments for rich inline documentation.
- **Highlighting Support in Editors**
  Designed for easy integration with editor tooling.
