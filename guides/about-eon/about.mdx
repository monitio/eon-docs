Eon is a semi-modern programming language designed to be approachable and efficient. Its mission is to make programming easier, more enjoyable, and accessible for everyone—from complete beginners to experienced developers.

---

## Vision

The vision behind Eon is to make it easy to create simple and capable applications using straightforward code and to generate working JavaScript as a first-class output. Eon aims to allow developers to build everything from quick prototypes to robust apps, all while making the transition from broken web code to full apps that work seamless and enjoyable.

---

## Origins

Eon was created out of personal frustration: the creator disliked JavaScript but still wanted a language that was simple, functional, and powerful—like C, which “makes basically everything”. Eon was born from the desire to combine simplicity and expressiveness with the capability to generate efficient JavaScript, fixing the web experience by offering a language that feels good to use and produces reliable results.

## Community & Development

Eon is an open project. Contributions, feedback, and ideas from the community drive its growth and direction. The language and its ecosystem are developed with inclusivity, transparency, and collaboration at their core.

## Why Eon?

- **True "Write once, run everywhere":** Use the same codebase to target C, Python, or JavaScript—build native binaries for any platform or generate scripts for the web and beyond.
- **Readable and maintainable:** Eon's syntax is clean and easy to understand, making it welcoming for beginners and efficient for experienced developers.
- **Automatic type inference:** No need to declare types explicitly; Eon figures out types for you to simplify development.
- **Versatile and efficient:** Quickly move from prototype to production with fast code and flexible output options.
- **Modern and future-ready:** Designed with today's programming challenges in mind, supporting both scripting and compiled workflows.
- **Community-driven:** Shaped and improved by the people who use it, with a focus on feedback and inclusivity.
