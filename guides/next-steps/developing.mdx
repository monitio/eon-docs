Congratulations on getting started with Eon! Now that you have **completed** the [quickstart](/guides/get-started/quickstart) and [CLI](/guides/next-steps/CLI), you need to know how to code in Eon.
The [standard library](/library/) provides a solid foundation, but you can also write your own code to extend Eon's capabilities. Because of this we recommend going to the [standard library documentation](/library/) and the
[language references](/library/references/) to continue your journey.
