## Setup your environment

Installing the things Eon needs to work.

### Windows:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="download" title="Download tools">
    To make the most of Eon, you need to install the following tools:

    <Accordion title="100% needed">
      - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (Always needed to clone and manage repos)
      - [Eon](https://github.com/monitio/eon/releases) (The main Eon toolchain)
      - [MinGW64](https://winlibs.com/) (A native Windows port of Mingw tools)
      - [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install) (A package manager for Windows)
      - [Clang/LLVM](https://clang.llvm.org/) (Needed for compiling from C to native binaries)

      <Note>
        Make sure you install the **64-bit** version of **MinGW64**.
        And also make sure you install the **Clang/LLVM toolchain** through **Chocolatey** using the command `choco install llvm`.
      </Note>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Optional but recommended">
    - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (version **22.16.0 or higher** for JS
      support)
    - [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version **3.10 or higher** for
      Python support)
    </Accordion>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Setting up the environment">
    If you installed the **tools above**, you should be ***fine*** and all ready to go.

    <Note>
      If you installed the **optionally** ***recommended*** tools, you will get more functionality when using Eon.
    </Note>

    Now you can run `eon.exe` from your terminal. If you installed the tools correctly, you should see something similar to this message:
    ```powershell
    $ eon.exe
    [30/05/25 | 20:05:00] [LOG] Usage: eon.exe <*.eon> <output>
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Linux:

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="100% needed">
      - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (Always needed to clone and manage repositories)
      - [Eon](https://github.com/monitio/eon/releases) (The main Eon toolchain)
      - **C Compiler** (needed for native binaries):

    <Accordion title="Optional but recommended">
      - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (version **22.16.0 or higher** for JS support)
      - [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version **3.10 or higher** for Python support)
    </Accordion>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Setting up the environment">
    Once you've installed **all required tools**, you should be ready to use Eon from your terminal.

    <Note>
      If you installed the **optionally** ***recommended*** tools, you will get more functionality when using Eon, such as Python and JS transpilation support.
    </Note>

    Now you can run `eon` from your terminal. If you installed the tools correctly, you should see something similar to this message:
    ```bash
    $ eon
    [30/05/25 | 20:05:00] [LOG] Usage: eon <*.eon> <output>
    ```
